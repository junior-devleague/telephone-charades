# telephone-charades

A twist on the classic telephone game! Students pass on charades instead of whispering words to represent concepts.

## Objective

Break the ice, form team bonds within the classroom, and review terms learned previously. Students will pass down charades in a line. The last person tries to guess what the term is based on the charade. The team that guesses the right term first wins!

## General  
Notes | Expectations
--------|------------
Group Size | 10+, Even Number Best   
Instructors | 2+ (1 possible)
Prep Time | 5-10 minutes
Activity Time | 15 - 20 minutes
Noise Level | Low (Should be silent)
Beware | If the words are too hard students might not want to act out and may shrug, passing nonchalance on quickly!

## Preparation

Instructor should prepare the following:
* List of ~10+ terms relatively easy to act out.

## Activity 

### Rules
* No talking or "mouthing" (silently trying to say) the term
* No looking back (each student should be facing all in one direction)

### Arrangement

1. Form 2 (or more) equally distributed lines of students.
  * Students must all face one direction. Each person should be facing the back of another person.
2. 1 Instructor (you) stands at the front of the line (you should see the student's back). 1 Instructor stands at the back of the line (they should see the student's front).
3. Have the 1st person of each line approach you. Show them 1 term.

### On your Mark, Get Set, Go!   
1. Each student goes back to their respective line and taps on the shoulder of the next person. They then face each other. The student will have to act out the term to the best of their ability.
2. Once the next student thinks they know what the term is (or even if they don't), they tap the shoulder of the next person and pass on the charade (or think of a new one if they feel like they know a better way to act it out).

### Winner!
1. After the last person in the line receives the charade, they will approach the instructor at the back and whisper what they think the word is (the back instructor should know what the correct word is). You can choose what you would like to happen at this point. You can give them the ability to guess again, or wait until the next team answers.

### Next Round
1. The person in the front goes to the back.
2. The process begins again until everyone gets a chance to be the first person in the line.
